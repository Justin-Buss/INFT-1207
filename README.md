# LabCode-INFT-1207

Lab 1 consisted of creating a program to generate a psuedo-random password using inputs taken from the user. These inputs include the total length of the password, the number of letters required, the number of digits needed, and the number of special characters. The get_user_input() function simply takes the input of each of these values from the user and does error checking. We do validation checking by ensuring the inputted values are of type integer by casting the input to an int within a try-catch statement. We also check if the values inputted for the number of letters, special charcters and digits sum to the length of password entered. These values are then sent to the generate_password() function where the required number of numbers, letters and special characters are appended to a password list, and finally shuffled at the end to generate a random password. This password is finally printed onto the screen as well as the number of letters, digits and special characters used to generate the password.
